[size=12pt][color=purple]Description[/color][/size]

Allows users with permissions to mark topics as private and invite people to it, the mod also has a permission to see all topics marked as private without the need to be invited.

This mod only covers a vanilla SMF installation, if you have mods that adds their own queries to fetch topics then you need to manually apply the appropiate check to that code.

[b]for SMF 2.0.x only [/b]
